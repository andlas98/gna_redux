## Purpose and Inspiration
Occasionally I peruse through gaming websites such as Destructoid, Siliconera, and Polygon. Kinda miffed with how many sites I had to open at once, I aimed to develop this site to roll all the updates from those sites into one. It would be a coding project I would actually use after it was done AND promote mindful media consumption at the same time.

My inspiration for this site also came from a college friend of mine who was creating a similar aggregator for 100 Days of Code back in 2019. Shoutouts to you, Aaron!

*UPDATE*: I've since revisited this project to recreate it in React and TypeScript.

## Basic Functions
* Languages/Libraries Used: React, Typescript, Tailwind
* Provide links to various articles related to gaming (a la HackerNews), but personally curated
* Grab articles from multiple popular VG sites (Siliconera, Polygon, etc.)
* Loads a minimal amount of content (no infinite scrolling here) to keep things minimalistic and again promote mindful consumption.
